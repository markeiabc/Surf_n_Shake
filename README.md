When analysing the weather data for June and December, we see that there is not a large difference between the average temperatures during the two months.
  1. There is a little less than a 4 degree difference in the average temperature between June and December. 
  2. With both standard deviations being between 3-4 degrees, the chances of weather conditions going high above or below the mean are slim.
  3. The largest difference is the 8 degrees between the minimum temperatures that month.

All of the statistical data points provided show that additional analysis will be needed to best determine if the flow of business will differ between seasons. I recommend a further analysis:
  1. Review trends during these time for hospitality services. With the main customer of the surfshop being tourist, reviewing the stay data from hotels can be beneficial to see when they have spikes in reservations versus slower business.
  2. Look into the the average rainfall for each month. If some months are determined to have more rain, this will cause visitors of the island to stay indoors instead of outside.
  3. Benchmark against other surf shops on the island to get a sense of customer flow. Identify the number of customers they have each season and if a possible influx during one season can balance out a lull during anothe season. 
  4. Confirm any other factors that would cause someone to not want to surf. This will help ensure we are looking at multiple factors instead of just one.
